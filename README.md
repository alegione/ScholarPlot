# ScholarPlot
Shiny tool for visualising and exporting google scholar data

The tool leans on the fantastic 'Scholar' package by Yu et al (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scholar/)

Unfortunately google appears to block scaping data when this tool is loaded onto the web (e.g. at shinyapps.io).

Therefore, you'll need to copy the script locally and launch it in Rstudio to use it.

Just download, open in Rstudio, and click the 'Run App' button
